# Termux-Password-Cracker (Infosec Piyush) ðŸ”¥

A versatile Mobile friendly Python-based command-line tool for cracking passwords of various encrypted file types (ZIP, PDF, RAR, 7z) within the Termux environment. It supports both wordlist and brute-force attack modes, providing a "green hacker vibe" UI experience.

## Features

* **Multi-format Support:** Cracks ZIP, PDF, RAR, and 7z archives.
* **Attack Modes:**
    * **Wordlist Attack:** Faster, uses a list of common passwords.
    * **Brute-force Attack:** Comprehensive, generates passwords based on character sets and length (can be very slow).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear, color-coded prompts and status updates.
* **Dynamic Progress:** Shows real-time cracking attempts.
* **DOCX Guidance:** Provides information on external tools (John the Ripper, Hashcat) for DOCX file cracking.

## Requirements

* Python 3 (comes pre-installed with Termux)
* `PyPDF2` (for PDF cracking)
* `unrar` command-line tool (for RAR cracking)
* `p7zip` (providing `7z` or `7za` command-line tools for 7z cracking)

1.  **Install Termux:** Download from F-Droid or Google Play Store.
2.  **Update Termux Packages:**
